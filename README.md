# The Board
#### Personal Whiteboard with Customization: A Digital Design Game

## Features
- All code in one .tsx file
- Multiple block presets that allow users to easily create their own board
- Grid locking that helps users place blocks symmetrically
- Side pop out that allows easy customization of blocks
- Image upload capabilities
- Board is downloadable
- Board saves to localStorage so nothing is lost

## The Game
This is a game because it challenges players to use creativity to create an optimized layout that will help them understand their vision. You can use it to develop characters, plan out a week, and pretty much anything. The possibilities are endless. But most of all, this is a game because it's fun. Yay!

## Future Edits?
- Block that enables the user to draw their own pictures
- A point system that rates a players board (like symmetry, amount of blocks, etc)
